>> The Let
let dog_name = 'cujo';              ----
dog_name = 'dogo';                  cujo    <---- Step 1
                                    ----
                                    dogo    <---- strp 2
                                    ----
JS doen't replace the exiting memory location's address with new value, but assigns a new value to new memory location and assigns the same variable name to it. And the cujo gets garbae ge collected

>> The const
const pi = 3.1414;
- We cannot re-assign a new valu to pi just like we did above for let key word.
